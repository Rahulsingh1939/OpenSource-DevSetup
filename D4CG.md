# Data for the Common Good (D4CG)

Data for the Common Good (D4CG) is dedicated to building communities, platforms, and ecosystems that maximize the potential of data to drive discovery and improve human health. By leveraging collaborative efforts and advanced data analytics, D4CG aims to transform health data into actionable insights for the greater good.

## Key Initiatives

### Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC)

The PCDC is D4CG's flagship project, aggregating clinical data from pediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA), and adult cancer patients worldwide. Utilizing the open-source Gen3 platform, the PCDC houses data on nearly 40,000 patients, providing a unified portal for researchers to explore and access diverse cancer data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### GEARBOx

Developed in partnership with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, GEARBOx is a decision-support tool that matches patients to potential clinical trials based on their clinical and genomic profiles, as well as trial protocol information. Initially designed for acute myeloid leukemia patients, GEARBOx is being expanded to accommodate other cancer types.

### mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements)

mCODE is an initiative aimed at enhancing interoperability by establishing a core set of structured data elements for oncology electronic health records (EHRs). This standardized approach facilitates consistent data collection and sharing, improving cancer care quality. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

# Project 6: Developing a Translation Service to Connect GEARBOx API with mCODE Trial Matching Service

## Description
This project aims to build a translation service that connects the **GEARBOx API** with the **mCODE** (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) trial matching service. The goal is to enable seamless translation of oncology data between **GEARBOx** and **mCODE**, allowing healthcare providers, researchers, and clinical trial platforms to effectively match patients to relevant clinical trials based on their mCODE-compliant health data.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Data Mapping & Transformation**
- **Interoperability & Validation**

## Skills
- **Python**
- **Typescript**

## Mentors
TBD - One of the Senior Developers in the team.

## Project Size
- **350 hours**

## Rating
- **Medium**
